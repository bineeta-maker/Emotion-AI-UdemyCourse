## KEY FACIAL POINTS DETECTION
Deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual Blocks to predict facial key points.


## FACIAL EXPRESSION (EMOTION) DETECTION
The second model will classify peopleâ€™s emotion. Data contains images that belong to 5 categories:
 - 0 = Angry
 - 1 = Disgust
 - 2 = Sad
 - 3 = Happy
 - 4 = Surprise

## MODEL DEPLOYMENT USING TENSORFLOW SERVING (WIP)
The development is in progress
